# KOMA script based template

this is my fork of [LaTeX-KOMA-template](https://github.com/novoid/LaTeX-KOMA-template), a sophisticated and very well documented KOMA-script based template for medium sized docs

my changes are mostly just a matter of personal taste configuration and some minor tweaks to remove errors and minimize TeX warnings (there are a lot) on Windows with [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) and [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)

work in progress, updated as preferences evolve

`LaTeX-KOMA-template-original` copy of the original template when fork created

`LaTeX-KOMA-template-working` initial working version

`KOMA-template` my current version of the template, this is the template that I am evolving
